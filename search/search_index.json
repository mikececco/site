Currently live in the Netherlands.</p> <p>Growing up, I had always been interested in science and computers. In high school, I went to a socio-economical school and studied economics and social sciences for 5 years. Then, in college, I went to H-Farm College to study digital management (which actually means nothing).</p> <p>Came out of college clueless of what I wanted to do, which lead me to do Product Management at log-tech startup. A broad role that had to deal with all the departments on the company. I was eventually laid off, which I took as an opportunity to pick up what I really liked doing. Building things.</p> <p>Spent 3 months upskilling with LeWagon's Coding Bootcamp which lead me to my current role as Fullstack Product Engineer for an event-tech startup.</p> <p>It was a very interesting 2 years. I had to learn to live independently in a new country, deal with losing a job and planning the trajectory for the upcoming years.</p> <p>I still struggle though to be hyper-productive. I love spending time reading on Twitter, Hacker News and other blogs about other people's experiences.</p> <p>I've also found a newfound role as a writer. Someone said that if you died and never wrote anything down, it was a wasted life. It's hyperbolic, but I understood what that meant.</p> <p>So I write with no predefined purpose, but I just want to put some stuff on a page and see if it becomes something else.</p>"}]}
