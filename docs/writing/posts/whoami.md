# Who am I?

In the next year, this blog will be painted with a mix of technical software development content and personal notes. I'm spending my 20s thinking about my life than software development. I'm not good at either, but I enjoy both.

## Life story

I was born Italy, from Japanese and Italian parents. Currently live in the Netherlands.

Growing up, I had always been interested in science and computers. In high school, I went to a socio-economical school and studied economics and social sciences for 5 years. Then, in college, I went to H-Farm College to study digital management (which actually means nothing).

Came out of college clueless of what I wanted to do, which lead me to do Product Management at log-tech startup. A broad role that had to deal with all the departments on the company.
I was eventually laid off, which I took as an opportunity to pick up what I really liked doing. Building things.

Spent 3 months upskilling with LeWagon's Coding Bootcamp which lead me to my current role as Fullstack Product Engineer for an event-tech startup.

<!-- ## Ouch

Near the end of 2020, I was diagnosed with RSI and had to take a break from work. I spent the next 6 months recovering and learning to live with the pain. I had likely worked too much and too hard, and my body was telling me to slow down. I'm still recovering, but I'm doing much better now. -->

It was a very interesting 2 years.
I had to learn to live independently in a new country, deal with losing a job and planning the trajectory for the upcoming years.

I still strggle thought to be productive. I love spending time reading on Twitter, Hacker News and other blogs about other people's experiences.

I've also found a newfound role as a writer. Someone said that if you died and never wrote anything down, it was a wasted life. It's hyperbolic, but I understood what that meant.

So I write with no predefined purpose, but I just want to put some stuff on a page and see if it becomes something else.
